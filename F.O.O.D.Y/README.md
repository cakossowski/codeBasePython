F.O.O.D.Y. - [F]antastic [O]rganized [O]ptions for [D]elightful [Y]umminess

Don't know what to cook during the week?
Tired of endless discussions with your girlfriend or rather she is tired with you?
Food delivery doesn't cut it anymore?

Be relieved! FOODY is your now preferred tool to manage your meals.
You can create new ingredients, new meals and set a bunch of different filters and then let FOODY
create a complete meal plan for several weeks.

Said meal plan will be generated into a pdf, which can be opened within the app.


## Technical details:

For now this app is programmed in Python, while utilizing Tkinter and CustomTkinter.
In the uncertain and unforeseeable future F.O.O.D.Y. will be ported to Android, but not Apple.

As I am rather new to coding and Python itself, I cannot make reasonable predictions how long 
this project will take, especially since there are a bunch of features, that I have lined up in my
mind for this project.

It also needs to be mentioned, that this is my first project of this scale and has to be seen as a
learning experience for me.


## Currently planned features for F.O.O.D.Y. :

1. Manage / create ingredients and set certain values for each
2. Manage / create dishes and set several properties for them
3. Calculate nutritional value for each dish
4. Create a bunch of preset filters to use
5. Ability to create own filters and use them
6. OMAD / TMAD option
7. Get complete ingredient list and create shopping list from it
8. Ability to share said list directly with others


## Conclusion

This will be an interesting journey and I am keen to see where it will lead me!

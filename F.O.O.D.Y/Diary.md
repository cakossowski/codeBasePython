## What is this?

Not a dream of a teenage girl, but some sort of log, where I write down my "achievements" of the day and certain 
notes for the project. I keep forgetting most ideas I had for this project and sometimes get lost in details.
So this is just a measurement to keep myself in line.

18th Aug 23:
- Added README.md / Diary.md
- changed overall comments / "commentstyle" and language in main.py
- fixed relativ path in linux environment
- Testing in windows still due, in case current solution not fitting I should create a function, that
sets the path in relation to the used user OS
-

# What is this?

Not a dream of a teenage girl, but some sort of log, where I write down my "achievements" of the day and certain 
notes for the project. I keep forgetting most ideas I had for this project and sometimes get lost in details.
So this is just a measurement to keep myself in line.

## 18th Aug 23:
- Added README.md / Diary.md
- changed overall comments / "commentstyle" and language in main.py
- fixed relativ path in linux environment
- Testing in windows still due, in case current solution not fitting I should create a function, that
sets the path in relation to the used user OS
- created that function, will test that soon
- externalized current_plan, help function into own module
- updated git

Ideas of this day:
- follow advice and maybe pack "window management" in own module oder pre-create certain sets?

## 21st Aug 23:
- experimenting with PyInstaller
- seems like not all packages are packed by PyInstaller
- fixed issue where logo.png couldnt be opened

## 22nd Aug 23:
- running into issue with opening PDf File on Linux after making it an exe
- found possible workaround, but unfortunately doesn't work for me at all
